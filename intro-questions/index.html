<h1>My Answers to the Introductory Questions</h1>
<h2>1. Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc.)</h2>
<body>My name is Brian Jihoon Lee. I am currently a Junior at WashU.</body>
<h2>2. Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</h2>
<body>I wanted to take Interaction Foundations because I wanted to take a deeper dive into how to write HTML because I feel that my career will involve me with a lot of UI/UX Design.</body>
<h2>3. Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS?</h2>
<body>I have some experience with HTML. I took a few courses online during my own time, and my past internship taught me some of the basics of HTML so that I could understand the templates that they were using for product listings.</body>
<h2>4. Name one thing you hope to learn in this class</h2>
<body>I hope to learn how to incorporate interactive elements like buttons and to make HTML look more aesthetic such as incorporating custom fonts.</body>
<h2>5. Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</h2>
<body>One way that designing for the screen will be different is that it will be much easier to duplicate and edit when it is on the computer. At the same time, the computer might not fully understand what I want if I do not specify what it is I am trying to do with the proper syntax.</body>
<h2>6. Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</h2>
<body>https://www.apple.com/  Apple's website, in my opinion, exemplifies effective design in that it is easy to navigate between the variety of products they offer. They also feature their most relevant products on their homepage adn the UI matches their visual brand identity.</body>
<h2>7. Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</h2>
<body>https://www.discord.com  Discord is an excellent platform that allows people to communicate with friends, family, teammates, etc. effectively through convenient voice channels, text channels, and individual servers to divide up what context you are using Discord for in a particular instance.</body>
<h2>8. Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</h2>
<body>https://www.amazon.com/ When I am looking for products to buy, I go to Amazon's website because of how easy it is to find the majority of the things I am looking for. The search bar is conveniently at the center of the page and the website also recommends what would go well with the product I am buying. This is a very good user experience for me.</body>
