            <p>Every man has a place, in his heart there's a space
                <br>And the world can't erase his fantasies
                <br>Take a ride in the sky, on our ship, Fantasy
                <br>All your dreams will come true, right away</p>
            <p>And we will live together, until the twelfth of never
                <br>Our voices will ring forever, as one</p>
            <p>Every thought is a dream, rushing by in a stream
                <br>Bringing life to our kingdom of doing
                <br>Take a ride in the sky, on our ship, Fantasy
                <br>All your dreams will come true, miles away</p>
            <p>Our voices will ring together until the twelfth of never
                <br>We all, will live forever, as one</p>
            <p>Come see victory, in the land called, "Fantasy"
                <br>Loving life, a new decree
                <br>Bring your mind to everlasting liberty</p>
            <p>As one</p>
            <p>Come to see, victory in a land called, "Fantasy"
                <br>Loving life, for you and me, to behold, to your soul is ecstasy
                <br>You will find, other kind, that has been in search for you
                <br>Many lives has brought you to
                <br>Recognize it's your life, now in review
                <br>And as you stay for the play, fantasy, has in store for you
                <br>A glowing light will see you through
                <br>It's your day, shining day, all your dreams come true
                <br>As you glide, in your stride with the wind, as you fly away
                <br>Give a smile, from your lips, and say
                <br>I am free, yes I'm free, now I'm on my way</p>
                
            <p>Come to see victory
                <br>In a land called, "Fantasy"
                <br>Loving life for you and me
                <br>To behold, to your soul is ecstasy
                <br>You will find other kind
                <br>That has been in search of you
                <br>Many lives has brought you to
                <br>Recognize, it's your life now in review (ahh-oh)</p>
            <p>Oh, oh, oh, oh</p>
